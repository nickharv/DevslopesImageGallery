# Image Gallery

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will be fixing the paths to service files, images, and pages of a Digital Art website. The website showcases modern frontend features, including mobile responsiveness using media queries, a Flexbox layout, mobile navigation, and CSS transparency.

The StackBlitz documentation says that the project should be opened in Google Chrome Browser to let the WebContainer load properly. Please make sure you use Google Chrome.

Please wait for the Project Web container to complete loading on the right =>>>>

After completing the assignment, feel free to explore the CSS and JS files to get a glimpse of the technologies you will learn in future modules of the Devslopes curriculum.

**!!! NOTE**: You will find the "TODO" items in every html file of the current project (index.html and all html files in the /pages/ location).
